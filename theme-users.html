				<b>One click demo import</b> is the easiest way to allow a new theme user to setup their site to look the same as the theme demo. In less than a year it became <strong>one of the most popular plugins in the WordPress repository</strong> (<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/advanced/">900.000+ installs</a> at the time of writing this). It has become de-facto choice by many theme authors. Many of them have <a href="index.html">implemented the configuration</a> and are recommending it to their theme users/buyers.
			</p>

			<p>
				It is possible to use the plugin even if the theme doesn't support it out of the box, but the experience is not optimal, because you as a theme user will have to find all the files and manually upload them. It takes more than a <strong>One Click</strong> to get to the fully working and configured WordPress theme demo. This is suboptimal.
			</p>

			<h3>What can you do about it?</h3>

			<p>
				The best thing you can do is that you contact your theme author and let them know about this plugin and how to implement it in their theme.
			</p>

			<p>Here is an example of the email you can copy/paste (or <strong><a href="mailto:theme.author@example.com?subject=Please%20configure%20one%20click%20demo%20import%20in%20your%20theme&body=Hi%2C%0D%0A%0D%0AI%20am%20using%20your%20theme%20and%20it%20is%20working%20great%20but%20you%20could%20make%20it%20even%20more%20user-friendly%20if%20you%20implement%20the%20support%20for%20a%20One%20Click%20Demo%20Import%20plugin:%20https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/%0D%0A%0D%0AThanks!">click here to auto-populate the email</a></strong>):</p>

			<p>Subject: <strong>Please configure one click demo import in your theme</strong></p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>Hi,</p>
				<p>I am using your theme and it's working great but you could make it even more user friendly if you implement the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/">One Click Demo Import</a> plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/</p>
			</blockquote>

			<h3>Where to find the author of your theme?</h3>

			<p>
				The easiest way is going to <strong>Appearance &raquo; Themes</strong> and click to a <strong>Theme Details</strong>:
			</p>

			<p><img src="images/where-to-find-theme-author-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
			<p><img src="images/where-to-find-theme-author-2.jpg" alt=""></p>

			<p>
				This will usually take you to the home page of the theme author, where you should be able to find the contact information.
